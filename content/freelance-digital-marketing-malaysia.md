## What is Digital Marketing?

![what-is-digital-marketing](https://loigoouddqshbpygboos.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/what-is-digital-marketing.jpg)

Digital marketing is defined as any marketing effort that uses electronic devices to deliver promotional messages and measure their effectiveness. Digital marketing refers to marketing campaigns that get in front of potential customers on computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, smart televisions, and other electronic devices.

We can also define digital marketing as the promotion of brands to reach potential customers using the Internet. Digital marketing includes various disciplines which include:

- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
- **Content Marketing**
- **Social Media Marketing**
- **Pay Per Click Advertising**
- **Affiliate Marketing**
- **Email Marketing**

## What is Freelance Digital Marketing?

Freelance digital marketing refers to the digital marketing services offered by freelancers to their clients. Digital marketing freelancers often work from any part of the world. They often help businesses with various digital marketing tasks with the main objective of making more money for the business.

According to We Are Rosie, only 36% of digital marketers believe that full-time employees are more valuable than freelancers. This study shows that organizations prefer working with digital marketing freelancers compared to full-time digital marketers.

This is because when an organization outsources its digital marketing work to freelancers, it can help them uncover new perspectives and result-oriented strategies that their in-house team might be lacking.

The demand for freelance digital marketing jobs in Malaysia is on the rise and is considered one of the best career options for fresh graduates with business degrees. As a digital marketing freelancer, you will have the flexibility to choose whom you want to work with. Moreover, you can also choose the type of digital marketing discipline you can specialize in.

Even if you choose to stop being a freelance digital marketer, you can utilize your knowledge, experience, and skills to start your own online business. You can also start a digital marketing agency or secure a high-paying digital marketing job.

## What does a Freelance Digital Marketing Specialist Do?

![digital-marketing-freelancer](https://loigoouddqshbpygboos.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/digital-marketing-freelancer.jpg)

There are hundreds of freelancing jobs in the industry, but freelance digital marketing is unique and provides the ability for professional marketers to choose the one they want to work with.

Digital marketing has several disciplines which require different skill sets.

![digital-marketing-skills](https://loigoouddqshbpygboos.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/digital-marketing-skills.jpg)

If you want to work as a freelance digital marketer, you need to have the necessary skills needed for the work.

When you work in a traditional job market, you will have senior members who can guide you. Moreover, the company you are working for will provide training to develop your skills. But this is not the case with freelancing.

As a freelancer, you need to find the right resources to learn the necessary skills related to digital marketing. Some recommended resources:

#### Work for an Experienced Digital Marketer

#### Experiment with Your Own Websites

Another way is to experiment with your own test websites. Apply SEO, social media, or affiliate marketing strategies to learn what works. If you can generate income from your own projects, that becomes your USP when approaching clients.

### Develop a Personal Website

Your personal website is your credibility. It’s the best place to showcase your services, achievements, and for clients to contact you. Avoid looking like an agency at the start; build around your personal name to grow your brand.

Blogging is non-negotiable. It builds authority, generates leads, and positions you as a thought leader.

- Write about problems your target clients face.  
- Provide actionable solutions.  
- Use it as a “lead magnet” to attract clients.  

According to SEMRush, **86% of content marketers** rely on blog posts. Blogging works — both for traffic and inbound leads.

Apart from blogging, grow your presence on social media and through guest posting. Benefits of guest posting include:

- **Position yourself as an expert**  
- **Drive quality traffic** to your site  
- **Earn backlinks** for better SEO  

Stay active in LinkedIn and industry groups to increase visibility.

### Connect with Other Freelancers

Networking matters. Reasons to connect:

- Share ideas and experience  
- Cross-refer clients  
- Outsource tasks  
- Stay updated with freelance industry trends  

LinkedIn is your best platform. Approach with personalized notes, never spammy templates.

### Choose Your Expertise

Don’t wear too many hats. Instead, specialize in:

- SEO  
- Social Media Marketing (SMM)  
- PPC  
- Email Marketing  
- Copywriting  
- CRO  

Specialization allows higher rates and better branding.

### Learn How to Create Winning Proposals
