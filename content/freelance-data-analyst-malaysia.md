In Malaysia, the demand for data analysts has been growing as well. According to [**Eduspiral**](https://eduspiral.com/about-us-eduspiral-consultant-services/advise-best-course-study-top-private-universities-malaysia/top-guides-choosing-the-best-course/top-job-demand-high-salary-reports-malaysia-by-the-courses-that-you-want-to-study/top-list-best-information-technology-it-computing-computer-science-jobs-in-demand-in-malaysia/data-science-analytics-high-job-demand-malaysia/high-job-demand-salary-for-data-science-big-data-analytics-data-scientist-in-malaysia/), Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) unveiled a plan supported by seven public and private institutes of higher education (IHLs), to increase the number of data analysts from 80 to 2,000 by the year 2020.

## What Is Data Analysis?

![what-is-data-analysis](https://loigoouddqshbpygboos.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/what-is-data-analysis.jpg)

You can always see that data analytics is often combined with data science. But there is a significant difference between these two concepts.

Data science involves both programming and statistical analysis which leads to the development of algorithms and predictive mathematical models. It’s commonly used to process and manipulate data.

Data analysis is a process of identifying, cleaning, analyzing, transforming, and modelling data into useful information. This information is used by companies to make effective business decisions. The main purpose of data analysis is to extract and collect useful information from data and develop solutions through the data analysis process.

For example, a company is looking to launch a product in a new country. Data analysis can provide insights to understand the consumer behaviour of that country and make necessary changes to their marketing campaign.

## Why You Should Become a Freelance Data Analyst in Malaysia?

Being a freelance data analyst allows you to take on different clients rather than working full-time for a company. You will have the flexibility to work on your terms and timing when you’re working on freelance data analysis projects.

Moreover, you can have a better work/life balance and have the freedom to choose the clients or projects that you want to work with.

However, with great benefits comes great challenges. When you work as a freelancer, the workflow of your projects can be unpredictable. You also need to constantly market your services and build your personal brand to attract more clients. Your freelance data analyst career should be treated as a business if you want to stand out from the crowd.

## What Skills Do You Need to Become A Successful Freelance Data Analyst in Malaysia?
